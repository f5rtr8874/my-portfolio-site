# Portfolio Website - Simple Deployment Guide

This guide will help you deploy your portfolio website using **Vercel** (frontend) and **Railway** (backend).

## ðŸš€ Quick Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Deploy Backend to Railway

1. **Sign up for Railway**
   - Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
   - Sign up with your GitHub account

2. **Deploy Backend**
   - Click "New Project" â†’ "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Select your GitHub repository
   - Railway will automatically detect the Python app
   - Set these environment variables in Railway:
     ```
     PORT=8001
     MONGO_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/portfolio_db
     ```

3. **Get Your Backend URL**
   - After deployment, Railway will give you a URL like:
   - `https://your-app-name.railway.app`
   - **Copy this URL** - you'll need it for the frontend!

### Step 2: Deploy Frontend to Vercel

1. **Sign up for Vercel**
   - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Sign up with your GitHub account

2. **Deploy Frontend**
   - Click "New Project" â†’ Select your GitHub repository
   - Vercel will automatically detect the React app
   - Set these environment variables in Vercel:
     ```
     VITE_BACKEND_URL=https://your-backend-url.railway.app
     ```
   - Replace `your-backend-url.railway.app` with your actual Railway URL

3. **Configure Build Settings**
   - Root Directory: `frontend`
   - Build Command: `yarn build`
   - Output Directory: `dist`

### Step 3: Update Database (Optional)

For production, you might want to use a cloud database:

1. **MongoDB Atlas (Free)**
   - Go to [mongodb.com/cloud/atlas](https://mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)
   - Create a free cluster
   - Get your connection string
   - Update `MONGO_URL` in Railway to your Atlas connection string
