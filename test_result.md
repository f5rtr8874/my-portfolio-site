# Portfolio Website Test Results

## User Problem Statement
Create a personal portfolio website to showcase work in photography, videography, and 3D design. It should include an about section, a projects page, and a contact form.

## Project Structure Created
- Backend: FastAPI server with MongoDB integration
- Frontend: React with Vite, Tailwind CSS, and React Router
- Database: MongoDB for storing projects and contact messages

## Features Implemented

### Backend (FastAPI)
- Health check endpoint (`/api/health`)
- Projects API endpoints:
  - GET `/api/projects` - Get all projects or filter by category
  - GET `/api/projects/{id}` - Get specific project
  - POST `/api/projects` - Create new project (with image upload)
- Contact API endpoints:
  - POST `/api/contact` - Submit contact form
  - GET `/api/contact` - Get all contact messages

### Frontend (React)
- **Header**: Navigation with responsive mobile menu
- **Hero Section**: Eye-catching landing area with call-to-action buttons
- **About Section**: Personal introduction with skills showcase
- **Projects Section**: Grid layout with category filtering
- **Contact Section**: Contact form with validation and contact info
- **Footer**: Site links and branding

### Key Features
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Image upload support (base64 encoding)
- Category filtering for projects (Photography, Videography, 3D Design)
- Contact form with API integration
- Loading states and error handling
- Mock data fallback for demonstration

## Technology Stack
- **Backend**: FastAPI, MongoDB, Python
- **Frontend**: React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, React Router
- **Database**: MongoDB with UUID-based IDs
- **Image Handling**: Base64 encoding for display

## Testing Protocol
- Use `deep_testing_backend_v2` for backend testing
- Use `auto_frontend_testing_agent` for frontend testing (with user permission)
- Always update this file before and after testing

## Current Status
- ✅ Project structure created
- ✅ Backend API implemented
- ✅ Frontend components created
- ✅ Basic styling and responsive design
- ✅ Mock data for demonstration
- ⏳ Ready for testing and deployment

## Next Steps
1. Test backend API endpoints
2. Start frontend and backend services
3. Test frontend functionality
4. Add any requested enhancements

## Notes
- All images are handled in base64 format for frontend display
- API endpoints are prefixed with `/api/` for proper routing
- Environment variables are configured for both frontend and backend
- Supervisord configuration created for service management
